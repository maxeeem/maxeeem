- 👋 Hi, I’m @maxeeem
- 👀 I’m interested in building [thinking machines](https://doi.org/10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about [neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaCmpygFfXo&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) and [artificial intelligence](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-professional-program)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building an [AGI](https://youtu.be/fJxHNtPazN0) which combines deep learning with a [reasoning system](https://github.com/maxeeem/NARS-Swift)
